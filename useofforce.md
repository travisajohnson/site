## FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS - USE OF FORCE

As [Beryl Lipton](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/beryllipton/) reported, the Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) commissioned a Use of Force Audit during the summer of 2015, to be conducted by the Association of American Correctional Administrators.

The audit came at a tumultuous time for FDC. Florida's largest and most costly state agency  faced increasing public scrutiny throughout 2014 and 2015, specifically with regard to use of force, but other issues as well. Most notably, ongoing investigations by the [Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/florida-prisons/) and other news organizations were published, exposing inmate abuse and corruption. The department's FY2014 Annual Report showed a near 100% increase in use of force incidents since 2007.

Florida's conservative legislature was calling for sweeping reforms as a result, Director Harry Crews, who initiated the audit in 2014, resigned before the audit got started.

One of the documents FDC produced in response to her request was a PowerPoint entitled [Use of Force Reduction Efforts](https://d3gn0r3afghep.cloudfront.net/foia_files/2015/09/28/UOF_Reduction_Efforts_2015_4rWtRSl.pdf), which described the Use of Force Advisory System as a way "to track and notify each Warden of a staff member who has been involved in 8 uses of force incidents within an 18 month period." It further detailed modifications to the system:

> "In November 2014, modifications were made to the Use of Force Advisory System. <b>Any staff using force more than 8 times in 18 months is reviewed</b> by the respective Warden for continued duty assignment or possible reassignment to another post. The Warden completes the review, documents the findings and actions, and forwards to the respective Regional Director for final review."

Curious to see how these efforts were going, I decided to follow up with FDC and file my first public records request with MuckRock. My reasons for writing about it here are two fold: (1) To share the results and lessons learned from making this request, and (2) to see if anyone's interested in contributing to the fees associated with processing this request.
